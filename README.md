# Noisy Sysmon Config
Here is a very noisy Microsoft Sysmon configuration file which includes rule name metada in every event. This should be useful for lab testing. It uses version 4.1 of the Sysmon schema and therefore requires Sysmon v8.0 or above. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

This config IS NOT appropriate for production use. Use [Swift on Security's Config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) for production. Also thanks to
